## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech stack

#### frontend
- React with TypeScript
- react-testing-library for components tests
- Cypress for e2e tests

#### backend
- Node.js
- Express.js with TypeScript
- MySQL database (MariaDB)
- passport with JWT authentication
- Jest for unit tests

## üìù About development

In this project, for backend, I used Node.js with Express framework. For authentication and authorization support I used passport middleware with JSON Web Token and custom passport strategy.

The project uses TypeScript and frontend-backend shared types. For data storage it uses MySQL database (MariaDB).

User and class records are handled using Active Record pattern. Each class provides basic validation and set of methods to add or modify entities in the database.

Routing is divided into two routes - user and class related. Most of the user routes are available only after authorization using verifyUser middleware.
